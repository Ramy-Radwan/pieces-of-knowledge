    <h1>F03 — Voltage’s job: how current changes</h1>

    <p class="sub">
      If torque is mostly about current, then the next question is:
      how do we influence current? The practical answer is: <strong>we apply voltage</strong>.

      <h2>1) Voltage “pushes” current</h2>

      <p>
        A motor phase winding is not just a wire.
        Electrically, it behaves like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resistance (R)</strong>: causes a voltage drop when current flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Inductance (L)</strong>: resists fast changes of current.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-EMF</strong>: a “generated voltage” that increases with speed and fights your applied voltage.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Beginner takeaway:</strong><br />
        Voltage is what gives you the ability to change current (and keep it at the level you want).
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="three" class="section">
      <h2>2) Three reasons you need voltage</h2>

      <p>
        When you apply voltage, it is “spent” in three places:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>R drop</strong>: part of voltage is used just to overcome resistance (heating loss).</li>
        <li><strong>L drop</strong>: part of voltage is needed to change current quickly (dynamic behavior).</li>
        <li><strong>Back-EMF</strong>: at speed, the motor generates a voltage that opposes you.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        We will later show the classic equation style (V = R·I + L·dI/dt + back-EMF),
        but you do not need it yet. The idea is enough.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="speed" class="section">
      <h2>3) Why higher speed needs more voltage</h2>

      <p>
        At low speed, the motor generates only a small back-EMF.
        So it is relatively easy to push current.
      </p>

      <p>
        At high speed, back-EMF becomes large.
        It is like the motor is “pushing back” electrically.
        To maintain the same current (and torque), you often need more applied voltage.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        This is one big reason why the <strong>voltage magnitude</strong> in SVM/FOC cannot always be “maximum” or “constant”.
        It must adapt to speed and load.
      </div>

      <p>
        Next: how do we physically generate the voltages we want?
        That takes us to the inverter hardware.
