    <p class="sub">
      Three-phase systems are often described with three signals (A, B, C).
      That is correct, but hard to “see”.
      The αβ plane gives us a simple picture.

      <h2>1) One perfect sentence</h2>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>The αβ plane</strong> is a 2D coordinate system that represents three-phase electrical quantities as a single vector,
        giving a clean geometric view that is easier to visualize and reason about.
      </div>

      <p class="note">
        You do not need to derive anything yet.
        We use αβ as a picture first, and the math later (only if needed).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="why" class="section">
      <h2>2) Why we use αβ</h2>

      <p>
        If you stare at three waveforms (A, B, C), it is hard to “see” the overall direction and strength.
        In αβ, you can often describe the same situation as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Angle</strong> = where the vector points (electrical direction).</li>
        <li><strong>Magnitude</strong> = how strong the vector is (how strong the electrical push is).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is exactly why SVM diagrams are drawn in αβ: it makes the switching limits and the desired vector visible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="use" class="section">
      <h2>3) How αβ relates to SVM and FOC</h2>

      <p>
        αβ is not “owned” by SVM or FOC.
        It is a shared picture used across motor control:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>SVM</strong> uses αβ to show what voltages the inverter can synthesize (the hexagon) and how to approximate a desired vector.</li>
        <li><strong>FOC</strong> uses αβ (and dq) to control torque-producing currents in a clean rotating reference frame.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        If you are going into SVM next: αβ helps you see the hexagon and corner vectors.<br />
        If you are going into FOC next: αβ helps you describe rotating quantities before moving into dq.
