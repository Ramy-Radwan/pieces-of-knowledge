    <h1>SVM 01 — What is Space Vector Modulation?</h1>

    <p class="sub">
      Motor control starts with three-phase electrical quantities produced by an inverter and consumed by a motor.
      To understand and control them, we represent these quantities geometrically as vectors in simple coordinate systems.
      From this foundation, techniques like SVM and FOC build higher-level behavior.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>10-second box: What is an inverter?</strong><br />
      An inverter is the power stage that takes DC electricity (from a battery or DC bus) and produces
      controlled three-phase electricity for a motor using very fast ON/OFF electronic switches.
    </div>

    <p>
      Space Vector Modulation (SVM) is a method that helps an inverter produce the three-phase voltage we want,
      even though the inverter is built from simple ON/OFF switches.
      In practice, this reduces current ripple and torque ripple, and typically improves DC-bus usage compared to simpler modulation.

      <h2>0) Inverter basics (why 6 switches?)</h2>

      <p>
        In motor control, the “inverter” is the hardware that sits between a DC source and the motor:
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>DC source</strong> (battery / DC bus) → <strong>inverter</strong> → <strong>3 motor phases</strong> (A, B, C)
      </div>

      <p>
        The important part is this:
        an inverter does not directly “generate smooth sine waves.”
        It is built from electronic switches (transistors), and each switch can only do two things:
        <strong>ON</strong> or <strong>OFF</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a three-phase motor, we need three output wires (phases A, B, C).
        Each phase must sometimes be connected to the <strong>positive</strong> side of the DC bus and sometimes to the <strong>negative</strong> side.
        That is why each phase uses a pair of switches:
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>One phase = two switches:</strong><br />
        – a “top” switch connects the phase to <strong>+DC</strong><br />
        – a “bottom” switch connects the phase to <strong>−DC</strong><br />
        (We never turn both ON at the same time.)
      </div>

      <p>
        Since we have three phases, we need:
        <strong>3 phases × 2 switches per phase = 6 switches</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Safety note (important):</strong>
        In each phase leg, the top and bottom switches must not be ON at the same time.
        Turning both ON would short the DC bus (“shoot-through”).
        Real inverters add a small timing gap (“dead-time”) to prevent this.
        You don’t need to implement dead-time here — just know the rule exists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now here is the key beginner insight:
        because each phase is controlled by ON/OFF switches, the inverter can only produce a limited set of “instantaneous” phase voltages.
        Those limits are exactly what the SVM hexagon will visualize.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="idea" class="section">
      <h2>1) The core idea (step by step)</h2>

      <p>
        The inverter’s switches are ON/OFF.
        This means the inverter cannot instantly output any voltage we wish.
        Instead, it can only output a limited set of possibilities defined by how the switches are positioned.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Think of SVM as a simple 3-step ladder:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Hardware reality:</strong>
            the inverter is made of ON/OFF switches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geometric limits:</strong>
            ON/OFF combinations produce only a limited set of possible voltage “directions.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SVM strategy:</strong>
            we switch between a few allowed directions fast enough that, over a short time window,
            the motor experiences the average we want. (We will show this visually in SVM 02.)
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        For this first article, we will focus on step (2):
        understanding the <strong>geometric limits</strong> produced by the inverter’s ON/OFF nature.

      <h2>2) The αβ plane (our shared picture)</h2>

      <p>
        Three-phase systems are often described using three signals (A, B, C).
        That is accurate, but it is hard to “see” what is happening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of thinking in three separate phase waveforms (A, B, C), we use a single 2D picture that is easier to reason about.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The αβ plane</strong> is simply a 2D way to represent three-phase electrical quantities as a single rotating vector,
        making them easier to visualize and reason about.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Another way to say it:
        the αβ plane is a 2D coordinate system that represents three-phase electrical quantities as a single vector,
        providing a clean geometric view of their behavior.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        You do not need to derive or calculate anything in the αβ plane yet.
        We are only using it as a picture to build intuition.

      <h2>3) From inverter switches → SVM hexagon (visual)</h2>

      <p>
        The SVM hexagon is not “magic math.”
        It is a picture of what the inverter can produce because it is built from ON/OFF switches.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How to read this diagram (for now):</strong><br />
        – The hexagon shows the voltage limits created by the inverter’s ON/OFF switching nature.<br />
        – The arrow shows the voltage vector we wish the motor to see.<br />
        – For now, focus only on where the arrow lies inside the hexagon.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        This hexagon comes from the inverter’s discrete switch combinations; later we’ll show the exact combinations that form its corners.
        The hexagonal shape comes directly from those ON/OFF limits — we’ll explain why it is a hexagon later.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mini-experiment:</strong>
        Try increasing the magnitude until the arrow touches the hexagon boundary.
        That boundary is the maximum voltage the inverter can synthesize in this normalized picture.
      </p>

      <div class="widget" id="svmWidget">

          <p class="widget-note">
            Preview only. In SVM 02 we will show the corner vectors explicitly and how mixing them over time creates the arrow.

        <canvas width="640" height="420" aria-label="SVM hexagon"></canvas>

        <div class="controls">
          <div class="control">
            <label>Vector angle</label>
            <input type="range" min="0" max="360" value="15" data-angle />
            <div class="readout" data-readout>
              Changing this rotates the desired voltage vector electrically
              (not the mechanical rotor position).
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="control">
            <label>Vector magnitude (0–1)</label>
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="60" data-mag />

              This represents how “strong” the voltage is relative to the DC bus.
              <strong>1 means “as large as the inverter can produce”</strong> in this normalized picture.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        At this stage, you do not need to know any PWM formulas.
        The only goal is to build a strong intuition:
        <strong>the inverter is limited</strong>, and the hexagon is a clean picture of that limitation.

      <p>
        At this point, your goal is simply to recognize the SVM hexagon and understand that desired voltages must stay within
        the limits imposed by the inverter’s ON/OFF nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next article, you will see the two nearest hexagon corner vectors and how mixing them over time creates the arrow.
        We will explicitly draw the corner vectors and connect them to the switching combinations.
