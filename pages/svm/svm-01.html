    <h1>SVM 01 — What is Space Vector Modulation?</h1>

    <p class="sub">
      Space Vector Modulation (SVM) is the method used in motor-drive inverters
      to produce smooth, efficient motor currents using only simple ON/OFF switches.

      <h2>The core idea</h2>

      <p>
        A 3-phase inverter used in motor drives can only switch its transistors
        fully ON or fully OFF. Because of this hardware limitation, it cannot
        directly generate an arbitrary voltage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Space Vector Modulation works within this limitation by switching between
        a small number of <strong>valid inverter states defined by the hardware</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reason about these states clearly, we represent each one as a vector
        in a two-dimensional plane called the <strong>αβ plane</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If you have seen the Clarke transformation before, the αβ plane will look familiar.
        If not, don’t worry — for now, think of it simply as a 2D diagram used
        to visualize three-phase voltages.
        You do not need to derive or calculate anything in the αβ plane yet.

      <p>
        Before going into timing, PWM, or equations, let’s look only at the geometry.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How to read this diagram (for now):</strong><br />
        – The hexagon shows the voltage limits imposed by the inverter’s switching hardware.<br />
        – The arrow shows the voltage vector we want the motor to see.<br />
        – For now, focus only on where the arrow lies inside the hexagon.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The hexagonal shape comes directly from the inverter’s switching limits.
        We will explain why it is a hexagon later.

              Changing this rotates the desired voltage vector electrically

      <p>
        At this point, your goal is simply to recognize the SVM hexagon
        and understand that desired voltages must stay within
        the limits imposed by the inverter.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next article, we’ll show how this desired vector
        is actually created in time using switching states.
