    <h1>SVM 01 — What is Space Vector Modulation?</h1>

    <p class="sub">
      Motor control starts with three-phase electrical quantities produced by an inverter and consumed by a motor.
      To understand and control them, we represent these quantities geometrically as vectors in simple coordinate systems.
      From this foundation, techniques like SVM and FOC build higher-level behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Space Vector Modulation (SVM) is the method used in motor-drive inverters to create a desired three-phase voltage
      by intelligently switching between the inverter’s limited hardware states over time.
      In practice, this reduces current ripple and torque ripple, and typically improves DC-bus usage compared to simpler modulation.

      <h2>The core idea (step by step)</h2>

      <p>
        A 3-phase inverter used in motor drives can only switch its transistors fully ON or fully OFF.
        Because of this hardware limitation, it cannot directly generate an arbitrary voltage.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Think of SVM as a simple 3-step ladder:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> the inverter can only do ON/OFF switching.</li>
          <li><strong>Limits:</strong> those ON/OFF combinations create only a limited set of voltage possibilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> SVM decides how to switch over time to approximate the voltage we want (we’ll do this later).</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        In other words, SVM works within the inverter’s constraints by choosing a sequence of
        <strong>valid inverter states defined by the hardware</strong>.

      <h2>The αβ plane (our shared picture)</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of thinking in three separate phase waveforms (A, B, C), we use a single 2D picture that is easier to reason about.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The αβ plane</strong> is simply a 2D way to represent three-phase electrical quantities as a single rotating vector,
        making them easier to visualize and reason about.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        You can also think of it this way:
        the αβ plane is a 2D coordinate system that represents three-phase electrical quantities as a single vector,
        providing a clean geometric view of their behavior.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If you have seen the Clarke transformation before, the αβ plane will look familiar.
        If not, don’t worry — you do not need to derive or calculate anything in the αβ plane yet.
        We are only using it as a visualization tool.

      <h2>Geometric picture (SVM hexagon)</h2>

      <p>
        Before going into timing, PWM, or equations, let’s look only at the geometry.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How to read this diagram (for now):</strong><br />
        – The hexagon shows the voltage limits imposed by the inverter’s switching hardware.<br />
        – The arrow shows the voltage vector we want the motor to see.<br />
        – For now, focus only on where the arrow lies inside the hexagon.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        This hexagon comes from the inverter’s discrete switching states; later we’ll show the exact states that form its corners.
        The hexagonal shape comes directly from the inverter’s switching limits — we’ll explain why it is a hexagon later.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Mini-experiment:</strong>
        Try increasing the magnitude until the arrow touches the hexagon boundary.
        That boundary is the maximum voltage the inverter can synthesize in this normalized picture.
      </p>

        At this point, your goal is simply to recognize the SVM hexagon and understand that desired voltages must stay within
        the limits imposed by the inverter.

        In the next article, you will see the two nearest hexagon corner vectors and how mixing them over time creates the arrow.
