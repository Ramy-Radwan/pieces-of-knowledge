    <h1>SVM 03 — Sector detection + mapping to switching states</h1>

    <p class="sub">
      In SVM 02 we saw the “magic picture”: two neighbor corner vectors + a zero vector, timed by T1/T2/T0.
      Now we answer the very practical question:
      <strong>how do we know which two corners to use, and what do those corners mean inside the inverter switches?</strong>

      <h2>1) Sector detection (which wedge am I in?)</h2>

      <p>
        The SVM hexagon is split into 6 equal wedges (sectors), each 60° wide.
        Your desired vector angle determines which sector you are currently in.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Sector rule:</strong><br />
        Sector 1: 0° .. 60°<br />
        Sector 2: 60° .. 120°<br />
        ...<br />
        Sector 6: 300° .. 360°
      </div>

      <p>
        So “sector detection” is basically:
        <strong>which 60° slice contains my desired vector angle?</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If angle feels abstract, revisit:
        <a href="/pieces-of-knowledge/pages/fundamentals/f07-ab-plane.html">F07 — αβ plane</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="neighbors" class="section">
      <h2>2) The two neighbors (Vx and Vy)</h2>

      <p>
        Once you know the sector, the two corner vectors are fixed:
        they are simply the two corners that form that sector.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Example:</strong> if you are in Sector 1 (0°..60°), the two corners are V1 and V2.<br />
        If you are in Sector 2 (60°..120°), the two corners are V2 and V3.<br />
        And so on.
      </div>

      <p>
        Then SVM chooses times T1 and T2 to “mix” these two corners so their average points to your desired vector.
        (That was the SVM 02 diagram.)
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        If T1/T2/T0 is still fuzzy, open:

      <h2>3) Switch states (100, 110, …) explained simply</h2>

      <p>
        The inverter has three phase outputs (A, B, C).
        At any instant, each phase is connected either to +DC or to −DC (by the top/bottom switch).
      </p>

      <p>
        A common way to describe this is with three bits:
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Switch state “abc”</strong><br />
        a = 1 means phase A is connected to +DC (top switch ON)<br />
        a = 0 means phase A is connected to −DC (bottom switch ON)<br />
        Same for b (phase B) and c (phase C).
      </div>

      <p>
        So:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>100</strong> means A is high (+DC), B low (−DC), C low (−DC).</li>
        <li><strong>110</strong> means A high, B high, C low.</li>
        <li><strong>010</strong> means A low, B high, C low.</li>
        <li>… etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        These are not “random”.
        They are the <strong>only</strong> instant voltage possibilities the inverter can create because it is built from ON/OFF switches.
        (If this still feels new, read:
        <a href="/pieces-of-knowledge/pages/fundamentals/f04-inverter-basics.html">F04 — inverter basics</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Each non-zero switch state corresponds to a corner vector in the hexagon.
        Example mapping (common convention):
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        V1 ↔ 100<br />
        V2 ↔ 110<br />
        V3 ↔ 010<br />
        V4 ↔ 011<br />
        V5 ↔ 001<br />
        V6 ↔ 101
      </div>

      <p>
        Don’t worry if you don’t memorize this now.
        The important point is:
        <strong>each corner is a real, physical switch pattern</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="zero" class="section">
      <h2>4) Why two zero vectors (V0 and V7)</h2>

      <p>
        There are two special switch states:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>000</strong> (all phases low)</li>
        <li><strong>111</strong> (all phases high)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In both cases, the motor sees “no line-to-line voltage” from the inverter, so these are called <strong>zero vectors</strong>.
        In SVM, we use a zero vector for time T0 to complete the PWM cycle.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        This is why many SVM sequences are written like:
        V0 → Vx → Vy → V7 → Vy → Vx → V0
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="next" class="section">
      <h2>Next</h2>

      <p>
        Next we can do one of two directions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direction A (math-light):</strong> show sector detection + T1/T2 computation visually with a small interactive helper.</li>
        <li><strong>Direction B (implementation):</strong> convert Vx/Vy/V0 timing into real PWM duties for the three phases.</li>
      </ul>
